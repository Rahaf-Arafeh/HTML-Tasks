    <h1>Page-level & inline CSS Styling</h1>
    <p style="color: coral;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
         Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                  <p class="text">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I 
                   will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the 
                   truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is 
                   pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are 
                   extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it
                   is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
